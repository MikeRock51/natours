Assignment: @Mrs. Akinrinde 
- Practice accompanying the song When The Saints Go Marching In [page 21 of the manual]. (Screenshot attached. She would need someone to sing the song to her while she accompanies).
- Practice accompanying the song Aura Lee [page 22 of the manual]. (Screenshot attached. She would need someone to sing the song to her while she accompanies).

Note: She should practice at a slow and steady pace with more emphasis on accuracy. (Chord reference is on page 31 of the manual).
 
Comments: She is a fast learner, but she needs to be more consistent with her practice for faster improvement. I recommend practicing 15 - 30 minutes daily.

Plan for next week:
- Learn the Am chords
- Chord drills
- Practice common songs accompaniment
