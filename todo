Here is an idea I have.
- We can have a fixed list of popular players that people are most likely to search for (between 100 -200??).
- A fixed list of top teams where top players are most likely to play.
- A list of top leagues as well.

So when indexing we check:

If the player is in the fixed top players list:
    we assign a high priority to that player

Else if the player plays for one of the top teams in our list:
    we assign a medium priority to that player

Else if the player plays for a team in one of the top leagues:
    we assign a low priority

Else:
    we assign no priority

Perhaps we can start here and improve on it?
